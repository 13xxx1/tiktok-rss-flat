    <title>It wasn’t hard to find people who wanted @Sleep Number pillows, but it took a bit more effort to find runners who agreed for me to follow up with them during the marathon about how they slept! Better sleep helps with performance, so this was a fun/playful</title>

    <title>At least I’m consistent 😅 I used to get so down on myself if I “fell off the bandwagon” of whatever I tried to do. Now I just reflect on why I didn’t keep up, make some changes, and start again without any negativity 🤷‍♀️ #runner #runtok #startingover </title>
