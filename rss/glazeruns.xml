    <title>This is what my runner's highs look like. 240 miles into Cocodona 250. This was day 7 of my 350-mile CocoCanyons adventure. I had run 340 miles and climbed 55,000 feet at this point. 10 more miles, and it would all be over. I was stripped bare. What a bea</title>

    <title>Happy Easter from the Glaze Family. Station visits from the family are always the best. Part of being a firefighter is missing a lot of holidays, birthdays, and milestones. But we make it work.  Smile, or you're doing it wrong. #firefighter </title>

    <title>It was such a fun month watching firefighters from all over the world running fire station loops. I hope you challenged yourself and possibly found that running is fun and a great way to destress. Please let me know how many miles you ran. Don't worry if </title>

    <title>Thanks for all the support over the past 4 years. Over 30,000 miles run. So many highs and lows. But all good things must come to an end. Happy April Fools Day. #runtok #runstreak #ultrarunner </title>

    <title>Low mileage month, but I'm happy with everything I accomplished. My racing season is getting ready to start, and I'll have plenty of opportunities to make up some miles. Besides working a ton, I raised money for @llsusa and flew to Seattle for the @firefi</title>

    <title>Pulled off the win although I had to really work for it. 100 miles/161 km does not come easily. Especially when the race starts at 6pm. Born to Run 100 miler was an incredible experience and I will be back. #runtok #ultramarathon #ultrarunner #borntorun </title>
