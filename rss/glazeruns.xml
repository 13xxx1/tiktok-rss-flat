    <title>Badwater 135 taught me a lot about failure. I was in the best shape of my life, but my electrolyte plan didn't work, and I found out very quickly what happens when my body shuts down. Uncontrolled whole-body cramps for 2 hours were one of the most painful</title>

    <title>Pulled off the win although I had to really work for it. 100 miles/161 km does not come easily. Especially when the race starts at 6pm. Born to Run 100 miler was an incredible experience and I will be back. #runtok #ultramarathon #ultrarunner #borntorun </title>
