    <title>Warmup race for the LA Marathon the next day. Ran 12 hours around Joshua Tree, drove home, ate half a pizza, slept 2 hours, drove to Los Angeles, and ran the LA Marathon in the Prime suit. The perfect weekend. Smile, or you're doing it wrong. . #runtok #u</title>

    <title>It was a good week for the haters. So many people unfollowed me. I'm surprised you're even here watching this video. It was a fun week regardless and I had so much fun. Hope this made you laugh. Smile, or you're doing it wrong. #runtok </title>

    <title>62 miles/100km That sock blow out caused a side blister that hurt. I had to clean it and put some kt tape on it so I could run the LA Marathon a few hours later. #runtok #ultrarunner </title>

    <title>Pulled off the win although I had to really work for it. 100 miles/161 km does not come easily. Especially when the race starts at 6pm. Born to Run 100 miler was an incredible experience and I will be back. #runtok #ultramarathon #ultrarunner #borntorun </title>
