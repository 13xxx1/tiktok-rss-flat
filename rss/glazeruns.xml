    <title>Happy Easter from the Glaze Family. Station visits from the family are always the best. Part of being a firefighter is missing a lot of holidays, birthdays, and milestones. But we make it work.  Smile, or you're doing it wrong. #firefighter </title>

    <title>Thanks for all the support over the past 4 years. Over 30,000 miles run. So many highs and lows. But all good things must come to an end. Happy April Fools Day. #runtok #runstreak #ultrarunner </title>

    <title>Pulled off the win although I had to really work for it. 100 miles/161 km does not come easily. Especially when the race starts at 6pm. Born to Run 100 miler was an incredible experience and I will be back. #runtok #ultramarathon #ultrarunner #borntorun </title>
