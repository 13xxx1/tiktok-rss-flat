    <title>Running 100 miles solo and unsupported means carrying a lot of gear. You never know what you'll need, so it's best to pack a bit on the heavy side. In the end, I used almost everything except my med kit. It's better to be over-prepared than under-prepared</title>

    <title>That was really hard. Here's the TL;DR version for those of you that can't watch the 8 minute version.  I know long format isn't for everyone but I hate making part 1 and 2. Smile, or you're doing it wrong. #runtok #ultrarunner #crazymountain100 </title>

    <title>Pulled off the win although I had to really work for it. 100 miles/161 km does not come easily. Especially when the race starts at 6pm. Born to Run 100 miler was an incredible experience and I will be back. #runtok #ultramarathon #ultrarunner #borntorun </title>
