    <title>These were brand new before the race. Only wore this one pair for the entire 250 miles. Although i did change my socks 10 times. Cocodona 250 is a very rocky technical course, and despite that, they held up well. I lost a little rubber on the back right o</title>

    <title>Well at least I'm certified! I've heard that's a hard certification to obtain. Remember you'll never meet a hater doing more than you. #runtok #runstreak #ultrarunner </title>

    <title>10 times during the race, I cleaned my feet and put on new socks. I also re taped any toes where the tape came off. I did get more blisters than normal, but I think that due to the technicality of the trail. Same shoes all 250 miles. Not bad, eh? Smile, o</title>

    <title>Pulled off the win although I had to really work for it. 100 miles/161 km does not come easily. Especially when the race starts at 6pm. Born to Run 100 miler was an incredible experience and I will be back. #runtok #ultramarathon #ultrarunner #borntorun </title>
