    <title>My 100 mile running streak almost ended. My hamstring is screwed. Decided to risk it all on one of the hardest races in the USA. Bighorn 100 miler in Wyoming did not disappoint #bighorn100 #runtok #ultrarunner </title>

    <title>I was awake for 38 hours and my body still wouldn't let me sleep. Between having to go to the bathroom, eating, leg cramps, and just overall soreness it takes awhile to get back to normal. Even last night I tried to sleep in and my body woke me up because</title>

    <title>I use Socal Ice Bandanas which is a local small business on Esty. not sponsored. Just remember to reapply lube as sometimes melted ice will wash your lube away. It looks like it's going to be a hot summer, stay cool out there. Smile, or you're doing it wr</title>

    <title>I'll be going back for the fifth time this year. A couple of big races beforehand, but this is always my favorite. It takes a little while to qualify and get into it, but I assure you, it is worth it, and the experience is unmatched.  Smile, or you're doi</title>

    <title>Pulled off the win although I had to really work for it. 100 miles/161 km does not come easily. Especially when the race starts at 6pm. Born to Run 100 miler was an incredible experience and I will be back. #runtok #ultramarathon #ultrarunner #borntorun </title>
