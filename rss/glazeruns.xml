      <title>Moab 240 miler in 3 days. There's a lot of packing and planning involved when you have 12 dropbags.  So scared. My body is in a taper tantrum. I've got to trust the process. Looking forward to seeing everyone out there. Smile, or you're doing it wrong.  #</title>

      <title>Running 240 miles solo and unsupported takes a lot of planning. I have to predict when I'll reach each aid station and what I’ll need when I get there. Hitting an aid station at 10,000 feet at 2am is a completely different situation than arriving at 2pm. </title>

      <title>Pulled off the win although I had to really work for it. 100 miles/161 km does not come easily. Especially when the race starts at 6pm. Born to Run 100 miler was an incredible experience and I will be back. #runtok #ultramarathon #ultrarunner #borntorun </title>
