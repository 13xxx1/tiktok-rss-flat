      <title>Just me? Nothing like thinking you were dying of lead poisoning all week only to discover the patient portal linked the wrong description to the test you took. I know a heck of a lot about lead poisoning now. Definitely not something that you want to get.</title>

      <title>Pulled off the win although I had to really work for it. 100 miles/161 km does not come easily. Especially when the race starts at 6pm. Born to Run 100 miler was an incredible experience and I will be back. #runtok #ultramarathon #ultrarunner #borntorun </title>
